# [Complete Guide to Cybersecurity: A Practical Approach](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/complete-guide-to-cybersecurity-a-practical-approach/)

I am taking this training course on LinkedIn Learning because I wish to get back into a job within cybersecurity. In late 2019 I already completed a cybersecurity in the classroom and in-person training with QA Training (based in Bristol, England) as a Trainee Software Engineer within Cybersecurity and Intelligence for a defense contractor. Then I worked in cybersecurity and intelligence for a couple of years. Therefore, I already have much of the fundamental skills within cybersecurity. However, I do understand that generally information technology develops quickly and I do enjoy staying on top of the developments and value personal development a lot. It is also important that I can evidence my up-to-date cybersecurity learning and this is one way how employers can track my learning and identitfy my updated skills within cybersecurity and ethical hacking.

### Resources

As a professional software developer I like to use certain official one resources and during a number of years of commericial work experience I have used a number of very useful online resources, software and tools to get the job completed in a timely manner as expected by employers today.

I have been using the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) online resource since work as a Software Engineer at Bristol City Council and this has helped me keep my work looking professional and the Digital Delivery Team at that organisation has appricated this because this is a specification for adding human and machine readable meaning to my commit messages.
