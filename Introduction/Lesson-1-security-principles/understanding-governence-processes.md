# Understanding Governance Processes

1. Procedures: steps to complete tasks that support organisational policies.

2. Polices: provide guidance to ensure that the organisation supports industry standards and regulations.

3. Standards: provide a framework to introduce policies and procedures in support of regulations.

4. Regulations: commonly issued in the form of laws and typically carry financial penalties if you do not comply.

Your organization may have different frameworks to introduce policies and procedures in the form of standards that are only within your organization, but there are also international and industry standards, and there are different examples of these standard bodies that I would like to introduce here to you. The first one is [ISO](https://www.iso.org/home.html), and that stands for the International Organization for Standardization. And, you know, this is an entity that develops and publish international standards on a very broad technical subjects, and in some cases non-technical subjects, as well. This includes information systems, information security, cybersecurity, incident response, as well as encryption standards, and many others. Another entity that I would like for you to be familiarized with is the National Institute of Standards and Technology, otherwise known as [NIST](https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework). They are an agency under the Department of Commerce in the US, that they publish a large number of technical standards and guidance. In many cases, you see them as Special Publications, right? And especially the Special Publications in the [800 range](https://www.nist.gov/itl/publications-0/nist-special-publication-800-series-general-information), those are related to cybersecurity, you know, in most cases. Another example of a standards organization is the [IETF or the Internet Engineering Task Force](https://www.ietf.org/about/), that's what IETF stands for. There are many different standards in communication protocols like the Board of Gateway Protocol, which is a writing protocol and there mean - of course DNS, IPsec and many other protocols you're going to be learning later in the presentation. So, this is a very, very important standards organization that you must be familiar with, you know, across the industry. Another one is called OASIS. And I belong to different technical committees within OASIS. On a personal note, I am the chair of one of the standards called the Common Security Advisory Framework, and it's a standard that aims to help organizations and individuals to automate the disclosure and the assessment of cybersecurity vulnerabilities in the industry. And it's becoming fairly popular. So again, that's another organization called [OASIS - the Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information Standards](https://www.oasis-open.org/), and there are many, many different standards out there like STIX and TAXII for threat intelligence, OpenC2, many other technical committees and special projects or open projects that they also have. The last one that I would like to share and introduce here is the IEEE. And basically, the [IEEE stands for the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers](https://www.ieee.org/), and they also set standards for telecommunications for computer engineering and similar disciplines.

## My questions:

The International Organization for Standardization [ISO](https://www.iso.org/home.html). Why is the letters 'S' and 'O' the wrong way around as in they have been switched over? See duration 3:50 of this lecture.

### Frameworks

- Essential 8 Maturity Model (E8).
- Information Security Manual (ISM).
- Protective Security Policy Framework (PSPF).

#### Essential 8 Maturity Model (E8)

A framework developed by the [Australian Signals Directorate (ASD)](https://www.cyber.gov.au/resources-business-and-government/essential-cybersecurity/essential-eight/essential-eight-maturity-model) to help Australian businesses enhance their cyber security posture. It outlines eight key mitigation strategies and defines four maturity levels that represent progressive stages of implementation.

The eight strategies address common cyber attack vectors and vulnerabilities, making it harder for attackers to gain access to your systems and data. These strategies include actions like patching applications and operating systems, using multi-factor authentication (MFA), restricting administrative privileges, and implementing application control.

The model defines four maturity levels:

- Maturity Level 0 (Ad-hoc): This level indicates minimal cyber security defence. Businesses at this level have not yet implemented any of the Essential Eight strategies.
- Maturity Level 1 (Basic): At this level, businesses have implemented some of the Essential Eight strategies but have not yet achieved a consistent or comprehensive approach.
- Maturity Level 2 (Intermediate): Businesses at this level have implemented most of the Essential Eight strategies and have a more consistent approach to cyber security. This includes the use of phishing-resistant MFA options for online services that store sensitive data.
- Maturity Level 3 (Advanced): The highest level of cyber security is achieved, with the Essential Eight fully implemented and updated. All staff are properly educated, allowing for agile responses to cyber threats.

By implementing the Essential Eight strategies and achieving a higher maturity level, Australian businesses can reduce the risk of cyber attacks, improve protection of sensitive data, enhance compliance with regulations, increase business continuity and resilience, improve brand reputation, and potentially reduce insurance premiums.

The Essential Eight was first published in 2017 and has been updated in 2021 and 2023 to better align the controls and maturity model with actual cyber landscape activity, helping to reduce risk.
