## Technical

Technical controls are also called logical controls. There are security controls that computer systems and network basically directly implement, whether it's a firewall, an intrusion prevention system, a cloud-based system on where you may have monitoring capabilities and different cloud security solutions out there. And again, you know, whether it's in the cloud or on premise, you may be already familiar with some of those technical controls. And then the last one is Administrative controls. These are also called managerial controls. And these are directives. These are policies, these are guidelines and advisories aimed at the people within the organization and they provide a framework and standards for either human behavior and other activities. And they should cover the entire scope of the organization's activities and the interactions with external parties and stakeholders. For example, a business peer, a business partner, customers and so on.
